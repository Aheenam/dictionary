# A PHP Dictionary package

This package serves the functionality of a simple dictionary. Mainly created for an own use case, this package will be helpful if you have a single table of words that need to be translated.

## Requirements

This package is build to be used with `php 7.2 or higher`.

## Installation

You can install the package by simply pulling it from packagist:

```bash
composer require aheenam/dictionary
```

## Usage

The main intention of this package is to browse and filter words and their translations in a given dataset. It does not provide any functionality to actually store it in a database.

The basic concept of this package is a dictionary as a collection of words in the base language of this dictionary. All those words have a list of translations which are basically also words, but with the difference that they are in a different language.

The word and its translations together form an entry of the dictionary. A entry must have exactly one word in the base language of the dictionary to be added to it.

Once you have a full dictionary of entries, you can use this package to search and filter in this dictionary.

### A dictionary

To use this package you need an instance of a dictionary first. The dictionary must be declared with a base language.

```php
<?php
use Aheenam\Dictionary\Dictionary;
use Aheenam\Dictionary\Language;

$baseLanguage = new Language('ta');
$dictionary = new Dictionary($baseLanguage);
```

#### A Dictionary Entry

The dictionary is a collection of a lot of words that can be translated. Words in the base language of the dictionary and the translations of this word for an entry.

```php
<?php
use Aheenam\Dictionary\Word;
use Aheenam\Dictionary\Entry;

$language = new Language('ta');
$tamilWord = new Word('அம்மா', $language, [
    'grammatical_gender' => 'f'
]);

$language = new Language('de');
$germanWord = new Word('Mutter', $language, [
    'grammatical_gender' => 'f',
    'article' => 'die'
]);

// An entry accepts as many instances of word as needed
$entry = new Entry($tamilWord, $germanWord);
```

#### Add entry to dictionary

Once you have an entry you can add it to the dictionary using the `add()` method.

```php
<?php

$dictionary->add($entry);
```

Note that you have to make sure that the entry contains exactly one word in the base language. Otherwise a `Aheenam\Dictionary\MultipleBaseWordsException` exception will be thrown

### Using the Dictionary

Once you have a full dictionary you can start querying it.

```php
<?php

// Search for the given word in base language
// This returns the full entry in the dictionary
$dictionary->find('அம்மா');

// Find all words that match the given query
$dictionary->search('mother')

// get all the translations of an entry
$dictionary->find('அம்மா')->translations();

// get the base word of an entry
$dictionary->find('அம்மா')->key();
```

You can also filter the translations to only have results in specific languages:

```php
<?php

// in() accepts as many languages as you want
$dictionary
    ->find('அம்மா')
    ->translations()
    ->in(new Language('de'), new Languages('es'));
```

### Updating the dictionary

Previously you might have already seen how to add new entries to a dictionary. You can do this by using the `add()` method.

```php
<?php

$dictionary->add($entry);
```

If you want to remove an entry you have to fetch that entry and perfom the `remove()` method on it.

```php
<?php

// remove this entry from dictionary
$dictionary
    ->find('அம்மா')
    ->remove();
```

#### Updating entries

There are no specific methods to update entries, but you can update the information of the key word and the information of the words translations.

```php
<?php

$dictionary
    ->find('அம்மா')
    ->setInformation([
        'gender' => 'female'
    ]);

$dictionary
    ->find('அம்மா')
    ->translations()
    ->first()
    ->setInformation([
        'gender' => 'n'
    ]);
```

However if you can not update the key or the language of a word. Since this didn't feel that logical we did not add this functionality. Instead you are supposed to remove the entry and add a new one.

Since the translations are a Laravel Collection, you can just use the methods that the collection offers to remove and add words.

```php
<?php

$dictionary
    ->find('அம்மா')
    ->translations()
    ->forget(0);

$mom = new Word('Mom', new Language('en'), [
    'note' => 'colloquial'
]);

$dictionary
    ->find('அம்மா')
    ->translations()
    ->push($mom);
```
